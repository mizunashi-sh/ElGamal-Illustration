# ElGamal-Illustration

A demo of the program implementation of ElGamal Algorithm

## Run the application
To run the application, Python3 is needed. The installation guide of Python3 is [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).<br />
Then, build the library. Open the folder *lib-source* in a command-line window and enter **py build.py setup** to build the library. In order to build successfully, you should install the appointed C/C++ compiler. [Click here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html?) to learn more.<br />
Last, rename the library as **Elgamal** and put it in the folder **ui**.<br />
Run the file **ui-source.py**.

## How to use
The guide is available while the application is running.

## Development Blueprint
It seems that this project will not be developed any more.
